# Fixes a couple of weirdnesses with Notionâ€™s markdown
#
# It does two things:
#
# 1. Moves misplaced image captions into alts of the images.
#    This assumes that all images originally had captions,
#    if it was not the case something bad will happen.
# 2. Replaces `#` with `%` in the first line of the file,
#    which contains the title of the document.
#
# Usage: ./fix-notion-md.py <filename>
#
